"""

This Streamlit application, named "ArchieChat," serves as a conversational interface powered by the `Hugging Face chatbot API` and `OPEN AI API`. The application enables users to interact with the chatbot by providing a text-based input and receiving responses in real-time. The primary functionalities of the application are:

1. User Authentication: Users can provide their Hugging Face login credentials (email and password) via the sidebar. If the credentials are already provided or stored in a .env file, the application retrieves them automatically.

2. Chat Interface: The main section of the application features a chat interface where users can input messages and receive responses from the chatbot. The chat interface displays messages exchanged between the user and the assistant, maintaining a conversational flow.

3. Message Handling: The application manages user-provided messages and assistant responses using the st.session_state.messages variable. Messages are stored in this variable to maintain continuity in the conversation.

4. Generating Responses: The application includes a function generate_response responsible for generating responses from the Hugging Face chatbot API. It constructs a prompt by incorporating previous messages exchanged between the user and the assistant, ensuring contextual relevance.

5. User Input Handling: Users can input messages using the st.chat_input function, allowing them to interact with the chatbot seamlessly. The application dynamically updates the chat interface with user messages and corresponding assistant responses.

6. Response Generation: When a user provides input, the application triggers the generate_response function to generate a response from the chatbot. It then displays the response in the chat interface, maintaining the conversational flow.
